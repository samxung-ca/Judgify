# Judgify
## Inspiration
If low on judges, or in need of a quick, fast and efficient overview of projects, judgify is your extra judge. 

## What it does
Judgify is a program that optimizes your hackathon judging process; import rubric of your choosing, and add projects with just one click, using your hackathon's devpost gallery link submission. It looks at submission descriptions per submission, and ranks them using your submitted criteria. You can find the mark breakdown and rubric weights below the rankings. 

## How we built it
Uses extensive HTML and Gemini API, initial renditions built using caffeine AI. 
## Challenges we ran into
Lots of Google Gemini API and Caffeine AI prompts, eventually running out of gemini credits MULTIPLE times and accounts later, really shortened our time. Debugging was a real b too. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
All of it was amazing to accomplish in a day. The User interface was quite well but took many many many iterations. 
## What we learned
Patience.
## What's next for Judgify
Expansion. Maybe a new API lol.
